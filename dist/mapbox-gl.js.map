and shifted) exponential function `f(x) = a * base^x + b`, where `base` is the user-specified base,\n * and `a` and `b` are constants affording sufficient degrees of freedom to fit\n * the function to the given stops.\n *\n * Here's a bit of algebra that lets us compute `f(x)` directly from the stop\n * values without explicitly solving for `a` and `b`:\n *\n * First stop value: `f(x0) = y0 = a * base^x0 + b`\n * Second stop value: `f(x1) = y1 = a * base^x1 + b`\n * => `y1 - y0 = a(base^x1 - base^x0)`\n * => `a = (y1 - y0)/(base^x1 - base^x0)`\n *\n * Desired value: `f(x) = y = a * base^x + b`\n * => `f(x) = y0 + a * (base^x - base^x0)`\n *\n * From the above, we can replace the `a` in `a * (base^x - base^x0)` and do a\n * little algebra:\n * ```\n * a * (base^x - base^x0) = (y1 - y0)/(base^x1 - base^x0) * (base^x - base^x0)\n *                     = (y1 - y0) * (base^x - base^x0) / (base^x1 - base^x0)\n * ```\n *\n * If we let `(base^x - base^x0) / (base^x1 base^x0)`, then we

Some labels have corresponding line geometries.\n * The points for both anchors and lines are stored in tile units. Each tile has it's own\n * coordinate space going from (0, 0) at the top left to (EXTENT, EXTENT) at the bottom right.\n *\n * ## GL coordinate space\n * At the end of everything, the vertex shader needs to produce a position in GL coordinate space,\n * which is (-1, 1) at the top left and (1, -1) in the bottom right.\n *\n * ## Map pixel coordinate spaces\n * Each tile has a pixel coordinate space. It's just the tile units scaled so that one unit is\n * whatever counts as 1 pixel at the current zoom.\n * This space is used for pitch-alignment=map, rotation-alignment=map\n *\n * ## Rotated map pixel coordinate spaces\n * Like the above, but rotated so axis of the space are aligned with the viewport instead of the tile.\n * This space is used for pitch-alignment=map, rotation-alignment=viewport\n *\n * ## Viewport pixel coordinate space\n * (0, 0) is at the top left of the canvas and (pixelWidth, pixelHeight) is at the bottom right corner\n * of the canvas. This space is used for pitch-alignment=viewport\n *\n *\n * # Vertex projection\n * It goes roughly like this:\n * 1. project the anchor and line from tile units into the correct label coordinate space\n *      - map pixel space           pitch-alignment=map         rotation-alignment=map\n *      - rotated map pixel space   pitch-alignment=map         rotation-alignment=viewport\n *      - viewport pixel space      pitch-alignment=viewport    rotation-alignment=*\n * 2. if the label follows a line, find the point along the line that is the correct distance from the anchor.\n * 3. add the glyph's corner offset to the point from step 3\n * 4. convert from the label coordinate space to gl coordinates\n *\n * For horizontal labels we want to do step 1 in the shader for performance reasons (no cpu work).\n *      This is what `u_label_plane_matrix` is used for.\n * For labels aligned with lines we have to steps 1 and 2 on the cpu since we need access to the line geometry.\n *      This is what `updateLineLabels(...)` does.\n *      Since the conversion is handled on the cpu we just set `u_label_plane_matrix` to an identity matrix.\n *\n * Steps 3 and 4 are done in the shaders for all labels.\n */\n\n/*\n * Returns a matrix for converting from tile units to the correct label coordinate space.\n */\nfunction getLabelPlaneMatrix(posMatrix: mat4,\n                             pitchWithMap: boolean,\n                             rotateWithMap: boolean,\n                             transform: Transform,\n                             pixelsToTileUnits: number) {\n    const m = mat4.identity(new Float32Array(16));\n    if (pitchWithMap) {\n        mat4.identity(m);\n        mat4.scale(m, m, [1 / pixelsToTileUnits, 1 / pixelsToTileUnits, 1]);\n        if (!rotateWithMap) {\n            mat4.rotateZ(m, m, transform.angle);\n        }\n    } else {\n        mat4.scale(m, m, [transform.width / 2, -transform.height / 2, 1]);\n        mat4.translate(m, m, [1, -1, 0]);\n        mat4.multiply(m, m, posMatrix);\n    }\n    return m;\n}\n\n/*\n * Returns a matrix for converting from the correct label coordinate space to gl coords.\n */\nfunction getGlCoordMatrix(posMatrix: mat4,\n                          pitchWithMap: boolean,\n                          rotateWithMap: boolean,\n                          transform: Transform,\n                          pixelsToTileUnits: number) {\n    const m = mat4.identity(new Float32Array(16));\n    if (pitchWithMap) {\n        mat4.multiply(m, m, posMatrix);\n        mat4.scale(m, m, [pixelsToTileUnits, pixelsToTileUnits, 1]);\n        if (!rotateWithMap) {\n            mat4.rotateZ(m, m, -transform.angle);\n        }\n    } else {\n        mat4.scale(m, m, [1, -1, 1]);\n        mat4.translate(m, m, [-1, -1, 0]);\n        mat4.scale(m, m, [2 / transform.width, 2 / transform.height, 1]);\n    }\n    return m;\n}\n\nfunction project(point: Point, matrix: mat4) {\n    const pos = [point.x, point.y, 0, 1];\n    xyTransformMat4(pos, pos, matrix);\n    const w = pos[3];\n    return {\n        point: new Point(pos[0] / w, pos[1] / w),\n        signedDistanceFromCamera: w\n    };\n}\n\nfunction isVisible(anchorPos: [number, number, number, number],\n                   clippingBuffer: [number, number]) {\n    const x = anchorPos[0] / anchorPos[3];\n    const y = anchorPos[1] / anchorPos[3];\n    const inPaddedViewport = (\n        x >= -clippingBuffer[0] &&\n        x <= clippingBuffer[0] &&\n        y >= -clippingBuffer[1] &&\n        y <= clippingBuffer[1]);\n    return inPaddedViewport;\n}\n\n/*\n *  Update the `dynamicLayoutVertexBuffer` for the buffer with the correct glyph positions for the current map view.\n *  This is only run on labels that are aligned with lines.

This must be an a JSON object conforming to\n * the schema described in the [Mapbox Style Specification](https://mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-style-spec/), or a URL to\n * such JSON.\n *\n * To load a style from the Mapbox API, you can use a URL of the form `mapbox://styles/:owner/:style`,\n * where `:owner` is your Mapbox account name and `:style` is the style ID. Or you can use one of the following\n * [the predefined Mapbox styles](https://www.mapbox.com/maps/):\n *\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v9`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/outdoors-v9`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v9`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v9`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-v9`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-streets-v9`\n *\n * Tilesets hosted with Mapbox can be style-optimized if you append `?optimize=true` to the end of your style URL, like `mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v9?optimize=true`.\n * Learn more about style-optimized vector tiles in our [API documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#retrieve-tiles).\n *\n * @param {boolean} [options.hash=false] If `true`, the map's position (zoom, center latitude, center longitude, bearing, and pitch) will be synced with the hash fragment of the page's URL.\n *   For example, `http://path/to/my/page.html#2.59/39.26/53.07/-24.1/60`.\n * @param {boolean} [options.interactive=true] If `false`, no mouse, touch, or keyboard listeners will be attached to the map, so it will not respond to interaction.\n * @param {number} [options.bearingSnap=7] The threshold, measured in degrees, that determines when the map's\n *   bearing will snap to north. For example, with a `bearingSnap` of 7, if the user rotates\n *   the map within 7 degrees of north, the map will automatically snap to exact north.\n * @param {boolean} [options.pitchWithRotate=true] If `false`, the map's pitch (tilt) control with \"drag to rotate\" interaction will be disabled.\n * @param {boolean} [options.attributionControl=true] If `true`, an {@link AttributionControl} will be added to the map.\n * @param {string} [options.logoPosition='bottom-left'] A string representing the position of the Mapbox wordmark on the map. Valid options are `top-left`,`top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right`.\n * @param {boolean} [options.failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat=false] If `true`, map creation will fail if the performance of Mapbox\n *   GL JS would be dramatically worse than expected (i.e. a software renderer would be used).\n * @param {boolean} [options.preserveDrawingBuffer=false] If `true`, the map's canvas can be exported to a PNG using `map.getCanvas().toDataURL()`. This is `false` by default as a performance optimization.\n * @param {boolean} [options.refreshExpiredTiles=true] If `false`, the map won't attempt to re-request tiles once they expire per their HTTP `cacheControl`/`expires` headers.\n * @param {LngLatBoundsLike} [options.maxBounds] If set, the map will be constrained to the given bounds.\n * @param {boolean|Object} [options.scrollZoom=true] If `true`, the \"scroll to zoom\" interaction is enabled. An `Object` value is passed as options to {@link ScrollZoomHandler#enable}.\n * @param {boolean} [options.boxZoom=true] If `true`, the \"box zoom\" interaction is enabled (see {@link BoxZoomHandler}).\n * @param {boolean} [options.dragRotate=true] If `true`, the \"drag to rotate\" interaction is enabled (see {@link DragRotateHandler}).\n * @param {boolean} [options.dragPan=true] If `true`, the \"drag to pan\" interaction is enabled (see {@link DragPanHandler}).\n * @param {boolean} [options.keyboard=true] If `true`, keyboard shortcuts are enabled (see {@link KeyboardHandler}).\n * @param {boolean} [options.doubleClickZoom=true] If `true`, the \"double click to zoom\" interaction is enabled (see {@link DoubleClickZoomHandler}).\n * @param {boolean|Object} [options.touchZoomRotate=true] If `true`, the \"pinch to rotate and zoom\" interaction is enabled. An `Object` value is passed as options to {@link TouchZoomRotateHandler#enable}.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trackResize=true]  If `true`, the map will automatically resize when the browser window resizes.\n * @param {LngLatLike} [options.center=[0, 0]] The inital geographical centerpoint of the map. If `center` is not specified in the constructor options, Mapbox GL JS will look for it in the map's style object. If it is not specified in the style, either, it will default to `[0, 0]` Note: Mapbox GL uses longitude, latitude coordinate order (as opposed to latitude, longitude) to match GeoJSON.\n * @param {number} [options.zoom=0] The initial zoom level of the map. If `zoom` is not specified in the constructor options, Mapbox GL JS will look for it in the map's style object. If it is not specified in the style, either, it will default to `0`.\n * @param {number} [options.bearing=0] The initial bearing (rotation) of the map, measured in degrees counter-clockwise from north. If `bearing` is not specified in the constructor options, Mapbox GL JS will look for it in the map's style object.

If\n * geolocation support is not available, the GeolocateControl will not\n * be visible.\n *\n * The zoom level applied will depend on the accuracy of the geolocation provided by the device.\n *\n * The GeolocateControl has two modes. If `trackUserLocation` is `false` (default) the control acts as a button, which when pressed will set the map's camera to target the user location. If the user moves, the map won't update. This is most suited for the desktop. If `trackUserLocation` is `true` the control acts as a toggle button that when active the user's location is actively monitored for changes. In this mode the GeolocateControl has three states:\n * * active - the map's camera automatically updates as the user's location changes, keeping the location dot in the center.\n * * passive - the user's location dot automatically updates, but the map's camera does not.\n * * disabled\n *\n * @implements {IControl}\n * @param {Object} [options]\n * @param {Object} [options.positionOptions={enableHighAccuracy: false, timeout: 6000}] A Geolocation API [PositionOptions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PositionOptions) object.\n * @param {Object} [options.fitBoundsOptions={maxZoom: 15}] A [`fitBounds`](#Map#fitBounds) options object to use when the map is panned and zoomed to the user's location. The default is to use a `maxZoom` of 15 to limit how far the map will zoom in for very accurate locations.\n * @param {Object} [options.trackUserLocation=false] If `true` the Geolocate Control becomes a toggle button and when active the map will receive updates to the user's location as it changes.\n * @param {Object} [options.showUserLocation=true] By default a dot will be shown on the map at the user's location.
